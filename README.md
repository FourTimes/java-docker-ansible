## java-docker-ansible

I'm going to describe how to build up this statck end end flow in this example. Here, I've chosen **Ubuntu** as the operating system.

Requirements

|SERVER| IP ADDRES|
|---|---|
| ubuntu | 192.168.0.10 |

_dependencies_

all the appliction are should running as a container. so you need to install the docker daemon and docker-compose  binary in your local machine. If your not installed in your execution machine please installit first.
